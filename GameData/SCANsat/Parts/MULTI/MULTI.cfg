manufacturer = [SCAN]: Scientific Committee on Advanced Navigation
description = This multichannel sensor detects radiation across several infrared, visible light, and RADAR bands. This gives it the capability to differentiate between terrain types and biomes. It can also detect anomalies such as structures on the ground.
