title = SCAN RADAR Altimetry Sensor
manufacturer = [SCAN]: Scientific Committee on Advanced Navigation
description = SCAN brings you this high performance RADAR altimetry sensor. This is the entry-level model in this sensor family, and commonly sold in a bundle with toy rockets and remote-controlled model planes. After focus group testing revealed that 95% of the target audience tried to duct tape it to the exhaust pipe of their rocket engines, this new and improved model has been made even easier to use.
