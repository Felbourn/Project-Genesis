title = SCAN SAR Altimetry Sensor
manufacturer = [SCAN]: Scientific Committee on Advanced Navigation
description = This Synthetic Aperture RADAR sensor uses its flight path to simulate a much larger antenna. This makes it possible to detect terrain elevation at much higher resolution. The downside is that its field of view is comparatively small, and it works better at higher altitudes.
