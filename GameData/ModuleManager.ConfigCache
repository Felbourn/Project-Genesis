AK10-118J is a really powerful upperstage engine although a little bit inefficient compared to an earlier developed engine, the LV-900. This engine fits perfectly with the Exploration Service Module and the light weight of the mentioned Service Module is better suited for the powerful engine.

			TyloFlyingLowCave = Upon visual inspection this appears to be nothing but an ordinary rock formation.
			TyloFlyingLowCave = While making a pass over the cave, all radio emissions seem to drop to zero, curious given Jool's normally high levels of background radio noise.
			TyloFlyingLowFace = The faint outlines of some kind of face-like object are visible on the surface here. Curiously, it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to Kerbal faces.
			BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The initial visual observation is difficult to believe at first glance. Signs of extraterrestrial biological life? An explanation for the unseen, lurking menace felt by all Kerbalnauts? Some kind of elaborate hoax? Closer study is warranted...
			BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The round cleft (a mouth of some kind?) glows brightly in a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. One can only hope that nothing will ever pry open that menacing cavity.
			BobFlyingLowDeadKraken = Observations show what can only be described as some kind of kraken, a Space Kraken if you will, lying on the surface of Bop. Dead, one can only hope...
			BopFlyingLowDeadKraken = Significant emissions of UV and X-ray radiation are detected. Observe caution when making any closer approaches to the entity.

"Open Fairing" is self-explanatory, the first "Decouple" option will decouple the main spacecraft and the second will decouple the lander/payload. I recommend binding "Open Fairing" and the first "Decouple" to an action group, performing your transposition and docking and then decoupling the whole spacecraft with the final decouple option.

The Multipurpose Express Pallet System (MEPS) was conceived by the boffins at our Construction Hardware store when a clerk used a gardening trellis to transport heavy boxes. Created to facilitate resupply missions to space stations or planetary bases, just attach any goods to MEPS frames and ship 'em away! Warning: We are not responsible for any harm caused by using them as a cell or cage. Doors not supplied, Kerbals may be stuck forever!

		RESULTS
		{
			default = Analyzed low resolution altimetry data.
			default = "RADAR Altimetry Sensor is reporting in. I don't know how, but we have a strong signal and are getting data. This calls for a celebratory round of snacks!"
			Sun = You wonder if the sensor is malfunctioning.
			Moho = Well, at least this low resolution data makes Moho look kind of cool. Not quite giant lakes of lava, but still cool.
			Eve = You contemplate the grainy, rough altitude estimates returned by the scanner and wish that you had sent the high resolution scanner instead. Oh well, it's a great reason to launch more rockets! (As if we really needed a reason anyway)
			Gilly = Your low resolution scanning confirms what you already knew: Gilly is just a lumpy rock floating in space. At least you don't have to strain your eyes looking at the report.
			Kerbin = Even this low resolution data of the planets surface is amazingly useful. You can't wait to deploy this technology on the Mun or beyond.
			Mun = The data shows broad, sweeping strokes of the landscape below. A high resolution scan would be more helpful, but you can probably find a suitable landing site using this data.
			Minmus = You grudgingly acknowledge that the guys over at the Kerbal Astronomical Society were right: Minmus really is a moon. You wouldn't have believed it if you hadn't seen the altimetry scan with your own eyes.
			Duna = This low resolution data is a bit grainy and distorted, but it will still be invaluable in searching for a proper landing site on Duna. Suddenly a long-term Duna mission just became a real prospect.
			Ike = As you pore over the data you are struck by how similar Ike appears to the Mun. You wonder about their comparative surface geology.
			Dres = Even with the low resolution scanner it is quite apparent that Dres has some prominent mountains. You can't wait for the resource scan results because you're sure "there's gold in them their hills".
			Jool = Altimetry, what altimetry? It's a gas giant for Kerbal's sake. Let's just pick a number at random and call it good.
			Laythe = The sensor seems unable to penetrate the water.
			Vall = Well, here it is: "The data you Vall been waiting for! Hahahahaha! Hahaha. Ha. Ha? What, SOMEONE has to find that funny."
			Tylo = You're still not sure what the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall, and Jool overhead would be like, but this data will sure help you find a landing site so that you can find out.
			Bop = Well, the low resolution altimetry data is in, and you decide to package it up and send it back to KSC. You just hope that there is enough juice left in the batteries to get it all sent and keep basic systems running at the same time.
			Pol = The low resolution scan confirms that Pol does indeed look like a giant pollen grain. Until you upgrade to a high resolution scan, and advance the field of electron microscopy, you will still be left with the question of how strong this resemblance truly is.
			Eeloo = The scientists back on Kerbin have been waiting for this data for a long time. No doubt there will be celebrations and snacks for all when it gets there.

			default = Analyzed high resolution altimetry data.
			default = "The High Resolution Altimetry Scan definitely is better then the low resolution one. SCAN has once again proven their scanning skills."
			Sun = You realize that you could have saved some money if you had trusted the low resolution sensor in the first place.
			Moho = Finally, the awesomeness has returned to Moho! It may not be giant flowing rivers of lava, but this data is spectacular!
			Eve = The high resolution sensor cut through the hazy purple atmosphere well, and you are able to distinguish minute details on the surface. The scientists back at KSC will be relieved.
			Gilly = Even in super-high resolution Gilly somehow seems to be in low resolution. That is one seriously lumpy surface.
			Kerbin = You become mesmerised by all the colors in the data that the new high resolution technology provides. Suddenly Mission Control awakes you from your stupor, and you quickly wipe the drool from the corner of your mouth.
			Mun = "Hah! No more boring grey moon. Just look at all the colors in that scan! Now we can really pinpoint a prime landing site."
			Minmus = Wow, not only is Minmus real, it has some amazing topography! You can't wait to land in one of those flat areas.
			Duna = This high resolution data is amazing. You begin analyzing the hills and valleys, searching for the perfect landing spot.
			Ike = The data confirms the presence of large sloping hills and craters. Hopefully the analysts back at KSC can use this to find a suitable landing place.
			Dres = Those... are some serious mountains. You are glad to be analysing this data, rather than trying to climb up some of those hills.
			Jool = Even in high resolution there does not appear to be a surface on Jool. So much for that theory. At least we still have the grant money!
			Laythe = The map shows mostly negative heights. You consider draining Laythe just so you can climb its mountains.
			Vall = The data from the high resolution scanner confirms that the surface of Vall is, indeed, "crinkly". Guess Gene owes you fifty funds.
			Tylo = Tylo may have been the first of Jool's moons to be discovered, but this data makes it feel like you are discovering the moon for the first time.
			Bop = Wow, look at all those colors. You have no idea what all that data means, but you're sure that this high resolution data will impress everyone back at KSC.
			Pol = Even with this amount of high-quality data it is still difficult to find a suitable landing site. How the heck was this moon made, anyway?
			Eeloo = The cracks and fissures on the surface stand out in striking detail as you examine the data from the SAR Altimetry Sensor. Just look at all those potential landing sites.

			default = "Wow, how are we even receiving this data right now? Those SCAN engineers really know what they are doing. Either that or they have not the slightest idea what they are doing. Either way, it's time for some snacks!"
			Sun = You are surprised by the lack of biometric data.
			Sun = you wonder why there are no poles visible on the biome map.
			Moho = As you pore through the data you wonder if you will find the elusive lava lake biome that so many scientists had speculated about.
			Eve = The intricately swirled lines of Eve's biome map remind you of lava lamps and tie dyed shirts. Man those were the days. Next spacecraft to Eve will have a mandatory disco ball!
			Gilly = Even with all that squinting those astronomers couldn't see the biomes here. Hah! Dumb astronomers! That's 1 point for science and 0 points for uhhhh... science.
			Kerbin = This biome data is truly astounding. You just hope that it is crumb-resistant, as you remember eating a particularly messy box of snacks the day that the sensor was installed.
			Mun = Huh, never knew the moon had biomes. Wonder which one the cheese is in. And if there are any other snacks there as well.
			Minmus = You contemplate how fitting the name "Greater Flats" is as you pore over the data. Whoever thinks up these names is one smart Kerbal, unlike the engineers we have around here.
			Duna = You comb through the biome data looking for just the right spot to gather all that sweet, sweet science data from. Mmmmm, science... and snacks.
			Ike = As you pore over the data coming back from Ike you are surprised at the biome diversity. After all it's just a moon. You can't wait to get your hands on some of the scientific data locked up down there.
			Dres = Poles, check. Highlands, check. Midlands, check. Lowlands, check. Ridges, check. Impact Ejecta, check. Impact Craters, check. Canyons, check. I think we got it all. Time to shut down the scanner and have some snacks!
			Jool = You are surprised by the lack of biometric data.
			Jool = you wonder why there are no poles visible on the biome map.
			Laythe = You want to throw a party every time the sensor detects a land biome.
			Vall = Pretty straightforward data: Poles, Highlands, Midlands, and Lowlands. That's a wrap. Now let's have some snacks!
			Tylo = You are struck by the diversity of the biomes in the report. Not only is Tylo cool to look up from, it's cool to look down at too.
			Bop = This detailed analysis of Bop's biomes will advance our understanding of the little moon beyond anything we could have hoped. It's been a great day. Snacks all around!
			Pol = As you take in the biome data coming from Pol you begin to contemplate the possibility that pollen grains have biomes too. Then you quickly squash the thought, knowing what the activists would be like if they got a hold of that idea.
			Eeloo = It is astounding to have such detailed biome data on a planet so far from Kerbin. You gaze in awe at the report as the data comes in.

Despite valiant efforts from their representatives, however, they haven't quite been able to shake off the bad press that followed some leaked footage of an incident involving one of their units and a small critter that one of the scientists over at R&D used to keep as a pet. Some say the incident has made them extremely concerned with the safety of anything that approach their products. They've even rounded out the edges on their company logo.

The company enjoys a well-deserved reputation for such an important contribution to the industry, and most agree that these days, almost nobody remembers the embarrassment of their recall of the FTX-1 series, which had a small but highly problematic issue, that while it did pump fluids flawlessly, it pumped them in the wrong direction.

		description = What this small company lacks in experience and reputation, it makes up for in the sheer ambitiousness of their projects. Their first product was the very massive Mobile Processing Lab, which rumour has it was first developed as a mobile processing facility to secretly brew an experimental, possibly illegal fuel mixture, which was reportedly far more potent than the currently available propellants, and had a distinctive blue tint to it. Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

Heavy research into two-dimensional-input driven procedural construction was then funded with the hopes of making protective shells for important payloads and interstage areas of the crafts. The protective shells also have the benefit of making the craft more aerodynamic, hopefully saving on precious rocket fuel! The AE-FF1 is the smallest size available from FLOOYD.

		description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

This new model features the latest in thrust vectoring and compression technology and is designed to operate best at higher altitudes and speeds. The advanced turbo ramjet design bleeds air around the compressor at high speed allowing a far maximum speed than regular jet engines, so engineers from C7 Aerospace assured us all those leaks are intentional.

Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

		description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

		description = The TT18-A Stability Enhancer uses ground-breaking fastening technology to significantly increase the stability of spacecraft during the pre-launch phase. While OMB Demolition has been criticized in the past for using "big fancy words for a rocket holder" in their description of their device, none can say the TT18 series doesn't deliver rock-solid clamping action, as advertised. The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance.

The NT-5R Shiba has a much smaller profile than its predecessor, but is less efficient due to its smaller power source. Because the reactor is always active, it will constantly produce electricity as long as the engine isn't being fired.
