Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

Their precision Decouplers are second to none when the job calls for splitting spacecraft into multiple smaller ones. Some of their other demolition products however, despite being heavily advertised as far more powerful disassembly tools, weren't nearly as successful. O.M.B. is still unsure as to why those "clearly better" products weren't so well received.

Their products reflect that pragmatic and arguably obsolete outlook, even in spite of the many newer companies that are coming up around them with alternatives that make space travel far more accessible than it was back in the "early days". Despite all this, the company has retained a small but loyal following of hardcore fans, who live by their vision of a very selective industry, populated only by the very best astronauts and engineers.

They are a massively large corporation, so don't expect them to cut you very special deals. They are already giving all their customers a bulk discount, plus their 'super-value' deals when using products from their partner brands. All this provided, of course, that you have your membership card with you when you go shopping at their warehouses.

The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.

Its internal battery supply is also very limited, being intended mainly to keep the Standby LEDs lit.

The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

		description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

			TyloSrfLanded = You hum a little tune while you work to make the time pass faster. Tylo has some really interesting rocks!

In order to sell the excess stock, we have mounted a fuel tank that'll extend the range of your rocket (slightly). Due it it's status as a mid range lifting engine, it is is able to operate semi-efficiently in thin atmospheres.

What? At least we figured out how to cool our engines by now.
