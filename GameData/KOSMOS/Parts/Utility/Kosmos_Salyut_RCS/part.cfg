description = This device is designed to work with all Kosmos products, but is specialized for use while attached to the Salyut series of space stations. Note that this block does not translate in all directions- it is recommended that a second, rotated, set be used at the opposite end of the craft as the first set, otherwise the craft will not be able to "back up" from a docking target.
