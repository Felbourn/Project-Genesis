	description =  The Kerbodyne Service Heatshield design is made for use with the Mk1-2 command pod, coated with a layer of thermal protection material at the Kerbodyne Main Production Factory. It is a large heatshield measuring 2.5m in diameter. Kerbodyne’s specially formulated ablative material, called Kerbcoat, is designed to protect the spacecraft and its crew from extreme temperatures during re-entry.
