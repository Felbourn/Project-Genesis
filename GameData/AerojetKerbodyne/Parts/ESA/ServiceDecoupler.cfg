	description = Fits and covers the Kerbodyne Service Heatshield fulfilling the role of Fairing for the heatshield and decoupler at the same time. It cuts off the things below it from the things above it. This unit also fits with an integrated fuel cell assembly to generate electricity from any nearby fuel/oxidizer tanks in the absence of sunlight contrary to the similar design of SDHI but with different design and fitting Kerbodyne Service Parts for versatility.
