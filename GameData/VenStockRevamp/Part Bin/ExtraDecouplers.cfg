	@description = This decoupler is the result of a dim-witted engineer hitting a ailing TT-38K Radial Decoupler with a hammer one too many times. This has unfortunately stunted the TR-8A's growth for the rest of its life, leaving it to be mocked by the other decouplers. This is Kerbal Engineering at its finest folks.
