0.31.3 - 2015.06.23
-------------------
For orbital bases, the OKS Workspace counts as an efficiency part for the MK-III Refinery and Fabricator.
Automated Life Support distribution now includes Food, Water, and Oxygen for TAC-LS compatibility.
The Akademy now includes a high-capacity research center.  Same stats as the MPL but three times the data and science storage, and requires two crew to operate.
MKS Aeroponics had cultivator efficiency reduced to only slightly better than OKS cultivation.
Fixed TAC-LS Kerbitat food conversion rate.
Updated descriptions to include new efficiency parts.
Fixed negative costs with 3.75m Kontainers.
Corrected some of the TAC-LS converters.
Logistics Rovers must be under 3 tons in order to be operational.


0.31.2 - 2015.06.21
-------------------
Updated CTT to reflect new modules
Created custom categories for Colonization and Freight
Lowered Power Pak fuel usage and fuel capacity by 90%
Fixed TAC-LS configs... again.
Defaulted tech node for all MK-V stuff to Advanced Construction if you're just using the stock tech tree (boo! use CTT!)
Reduced capacity of supply pak by 50% (no bags of holding!)
Tweaked down Ore storage capacities (5L v 1L)
Bumped up the cost of the radial MK-V modules
CommPak now has RT support
Added liquid tanks in a MK-V form factor
Fixed collision issue with inflating hab module
Corrected invalid animation in AuxCon
Fixed typo preventing Fertilizer from showing up in the supply paks
Fixed incorrect workshop converter ratios


0.31.1 - 2015.06.18
-------------------
Removed legacy folders since it turns out 0.31.x is save breaking.
Added colored markers to the hab and workshop inflatables to aid in identification while deflated
Tweaked the Agroponics converter vaules
Fixed texture issue with reactors
Updated TAC-LS configs
Added KAS stortage to the Koala lander

0.31.0 - 2015.06.18
-------------------
Fixed most of the log spam with the colony overview window. 
ScanOMatic Soil Sampler shows surface concentrations of all MKS resources
Rebalanced the greenhouse module:
- A USI-LS greenhouse or pioneer module operates at 50% efficiency
- A Mk-V Ag Module operates at 75% efficiency
- An Aeroponics Module operates at 90% efficiency
MK-V Ag Modules and the Aeroponics Module have a new converter called 'Agroponics'.  This adds fertilizer as an input (25% of the mulch amount) but in return grants a lossless conversion.
Added Fertilizer to various containers
Added Mulch storage to the Pioneer modules
Added Monoprop and LiquidFuel storage tanks
Fixed mass issue with water conversion
Fixed various cost issues
Temprarily removed the MDS part as it needs a rework
The HabDome, Agriculture Module, and Radial tank have been deprecated to 'Legacy'.  The Hab and Ag modules are replaced by Mk-V equivelants, and the radial tank is replaced by Kontainers.
The Fuel refinery now requires a Mk-V Mini-Lab as an efficiency part.
The Fabricator now requires a Mk-V Workshop as an efficiency part.
The Refinery now requires a Mk-V Sifter or Smelter as an efficiency part (either work)
Mobile and Module Bases now have attachment nodes
Efficiency Parts can now span disconnected ships
PDUs, when crewed by an engineer, can transmit power
Scrap Parts can now either be scrapped into recycleables or cannibalized for SpecializedParts
Removed Anchor/Dampener functionality as it is no longer needed with the disconnected base logistics
Added fertilizer and mulch to the OKS AgModule 
Added EL Workspace and KerbalStats configs
Added Filter Extension support for the octagonal profile
Added placeholder IVA for Akademy
Added storage for Machinery,Recyclables,SpecializedParts and Fertilizer to Kontainers
Changed Tank texture/model
Added new parts:
- Mini Rover - when crewed by a pilot enables disconnected resource transfers
- Ag Module (replaces the old Ag Module) - can independently create organics
- Airlock - serves as a vessel entry point
- Auxiliary Control - adds a radial command pod
- BallHub - structural connector
- Mini-Lab/Comms - Small low efficiency science lab and antenna
- Hab Module (replaces the old HabDome) - can convert organics to supplies
- Mini-ILM (small radial ILM)
- 'Koala' Lander (lighter than the module base, four MK-V attachment points)
- Mount-Point - Battery and surface attachment point
- 'Scout' pod - 2-man pod with built in avionics
- Power Pak - Depletable RTG and power distribution module
- Regolith Sifter - allows for basic resource harvesting, also an efficiency part
- SmeltOMatic - converts resources to raw materials, also an efficiency part
- Supply-Pak - Radial storage container
- Workshop - Allows basic fabrication, also an efficiency part


0.30.3 - 2015.05.02
-------------------
Added Changelog file
Fixed some log spam
Bundled new Kontainers/Tanks
Removed surface attach from Oct-3.75 adapter
Fixed various cost issues
Fixed missing textures for OKS ILM
Fuel refinery now has Uraninite and DepletedUranium conversion capabilities

Advanced Logistics:
* A PDU with an engineer can now transfer EC for the use of converters
  to disconnected ships within 2KM.
* If a converter module is within 150m of an MKS workspace module with a pilot, 
  converter inputs will be retrieved from disconnected ships up to 750km away.
* When using the context menu to perform maintenance, ships within 500m will be 
  considered when looking for resources to store or retrieve.
