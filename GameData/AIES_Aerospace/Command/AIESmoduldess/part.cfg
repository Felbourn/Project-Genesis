	description = Previously a deep water research bathysphere (which previously was a pressure cooker) is now used for interplanetary travel. The waterproof interior has a single seat for kerbonaut and a full set of controls to operate the spacecraft. The waterproof quality is achieved by newly discovered phenomenon known as 'There is no water in space'.
