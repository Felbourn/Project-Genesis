	description = After the initial tests for Space Program the Explon 5D probe was called 'squishy' by Jebediah Kerman, because 'the tinfoil is not hard enough for the rough reality of space flight'. The design was improved by adding external "1mm Steel Plate"™ and a plastic filling between it and the probes instruments.
