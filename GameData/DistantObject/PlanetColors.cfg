//Color definitions for planets

//Custom planet mods can add their own color definitions! Just add another .cfg file inside your mod folder (of any name,
//anywhere inside the GameData path), and mirror the format of this document.

//The color value is just RGB values, from 0 to 255. This is the color when 100% saturated (default is 65%, see Settings.cfg).
