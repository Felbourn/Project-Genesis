description = A MEPS Stack Adapter. Attach a docking port on the wider side and a MEPS Frame on the narrower side. The Multipurpose Express Pallet System (MEPS) was conceived by the boffins at our Construction Hardware store when a clerk used a gardening trellis to transport heavy boxes. Created to facilitate resupply missions to space stations or planetary bases, just attach any goods to MEPS frames and ship 'em away! Warning: We are not responsible for any harm caused by using them as a cell or cage. Doors not supplied, Kerbals may be stuck forever!
