title = K-170 'Tsar-Pushka' Liquid Fuel Engine
manufacturer = Kerbolyov Design Bureau
description = Not to be out-done by Rockomax's Mainsail, the decision was made within the KDB to build a yet bigger engine. Finding that the explosion to launch ratio of a single combustion chamber was uncomfortably close to 1; a shift to a 4 combustion chamber design, and a sadly more stable and less efficient liquid fuel, was required.
