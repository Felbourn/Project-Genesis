=== Concepts ===

	---life support---
	wear and tear, base maintenance

		<water> + <substrate> --> [organics] --> (supplies) -> Kerbals --> (mulch)

		Option 1
			convert water and substrate over time

		Option 2
			recycle mulch into new organics

	---maintenance---

		3 resources:
		<substrate>   --> [polymers]		these are all called [intermediate] resources
		<metallicOre> --> [metals]
		<minerals>    --> [chemicals]

		[intermediate] --> (machinery) + (rocketParts)

		Base building:
			(machinery) + (rocketParts) + [specializedParts] --> new UKS modules

		There is a base/module waste & recycling mechanic:
			UKS modules --> (recyclables) --> [intermediate]

		Advanced modules can build specialized parts:
			UKS modules --> (machinery) + (rocketParts) + [specializedParts] --> even new UKS modules

=== MK-V ===
	phase 1
	basic support feaures

=== Mk-II ===
	ground operations
	science and life support
	3.75m lifter

=== Mk-III ===
	manufacturing
	5m lifter

=== Mk-IV ===
	huge parts, ground and orbit, final phase
	5m expanded lifter

=== Mission Overview ===

	Use a logistics rover to "link" the base instead of connecting with KAS all the time.

	---Phase 1---
	Scan:
		MK-V. Find a base location. Scan for resources. We want water and substrate.
	Deploy:
		MK-V. Land some life support and power generation.

	---Phase 2---
	Expand:
		MK-V. Expand with harvesting and manufacturing.
	
	---Phase 3---
	Life Support:
		MK-II. Close the loop for supplies.
	Manufacturing:
		MK-III. Close the loop for production.

	---Phase 4---
	Upgrade:
		MK-IV. Remove MK-II and MK-III modules in favor of better MK-IV modules.

next:
	get supplies from where we are
	Regolith Silfter - power --> water, or substrate, or minerals, or metalOre
	UKS Aeroponics - machinery, power, water, substrate 			--> organics, recyclables
	UKS Aeroponics - machinery, power, mulch			 			--> organics, recyclables
	Habitation - organics, machinery, power --> supplies, recyclables

next:
	find a way to use recyclables that have been building up
