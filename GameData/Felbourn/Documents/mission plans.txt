=== Concepts ===

	---life support---
	wear and tear, base maintenance

		<water> + <substrate> --> [organics] --> (supplies) -> Kerbals --> (mulch)

		Option 1
			convert water and substrate over time

		Option 2
			recycle mulch into new organics

	---maintenance---

		3 resources:
		<substrate>   --> [polymers]		these are all called [intermediate] resources
		<metallicOre> --> [metals]
		<minerals>    --> [chemicals]

		[intermediate] --> (machinery) + (rocketParts)

		Base building:
			(machinery) + (rocketParts) + [specializedParts] --> new UKS modules

		There is a base/module waste & recycling mechanic:
			UKS modules --> (recyclables) --> [intermediate]

		Advanced modules can build specialized parts:
			UKS modules --> (machinery) + (rocketParts) + [specializedParts] --> even new UKS modules

=== MK-V ===
	phase 1
	basic support feaures

=== Mk-II ===
	ground operations
	science and life support
	3.75m lifter

=== Mk-III ===
	manufacturing
	5m lifter

=== Mk-IV ===
	huge parts, ground and orbit, final phase
	5m expanded lifter

=== Mission Overview ===

	Use a logistics rover to "link" the base instead of connecting with KAS all the time.

	---Phase 1---
	Scan:
		MK-V. Find a base location. Scan for resources. We want water and substrate.
	Deploy:
		MK-V. Land some life support and power generation.

	---Phase 2---
	Expand:
		MK-V. Expand with harvesting and manufacturing.
	
	---Phase 3---
	Life Support:
		MK-II. Close the loop for supplies.
	Manufacturing:
		MK-III. Close the loop for production.

	---Phase 4---
	Upgrade:
		MK-IV. Remove MK-II and MK-III modules in favor of better MK-IV modules.


=== Phase 1 ===

MK-V modules:
	Command Pod				- attach to top of Colony Hub
	Colony Hub				- attach 4 of anything below to each of these
	
	Agricultural			- mulch, power, machinery 			  --> organics, recylables
		or					- mulch, power, machinery, fertilzier --> organics, recylables

	Airlock					- 
	Attachment Point		- 
	Auxillary Control		- 
	Comm-Lab				- 
	Habitation				- 
	Inflatable Logistics	- 
	Inflatable Workshop		- 	
	Regolith Silfter		- 
	Power Pack				- 
	Portable Smelter		- 
	Supply Redipack A		- non LS supplies
	Supply Redipack B		- LS supplies
