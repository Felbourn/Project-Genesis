KERBINSIDE CORE
KerbinSide Core is for use as follows:
- You don't want the bases included in KerbinSide. You do want the static assets to make your own bases for your own personal use.
- You make and distribute bases using the assets in KerbinSide. You point to this as a requirement for your base pack/mod.
- You've been pointed to KerbinSide Core as a requirement for a base pack/mod you want to use.

KerbinSide Core is NOT for use as follows:
- You make and distribute bases using the assets of KerbinSide. You include KerbinSide Core in your own pack/mod.
- You remove some of the assets in KerbinSide Core and distribute that.

Please don't do this. You're violating the licence and potentially putting more than one version of the KerbinSide assets out in the wild, making my life difficult and confusing players.

If this happens, I'll restrict licences and if you make and distribute bases, you won't be able to any more.

If you would like a modified or pared down version of KerbinSide Core available for your base pack/mod then contact AlphaAsh on the KSP forums. I'll then consider releasing a version of the Core just for you.

KerbinSide Core requires Kerbal Konstructs. It's not included. You will need to go and get the latest version.
