		LaunchSiteDescription = The Zebedee Polar Launch Facility is a medium sized complex located near Kerbin's North Pole. It is essential for craft with a polar orbiting destination in mind. However, its position far from the equator impedes its ability to launch vehicles bound for an equatorial or low inclination orbit.

		LaunchSiteDescription = Located in a range of extinct volcanoes on the edge of Kerbin's Greater Desert, the appropriately named Deadkerbal Pit is the site of development of a new rocket launching facility where a number of fatal accidents has delayed further construction indefinitely. The launch platform is in active service, however, although many kerbonauts feel that any mission slated to launch from the site is cursed to fail.
