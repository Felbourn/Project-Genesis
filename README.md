# Project-Genesis

This KSP directory structure is a generic root installation for an extended, more realistic experience. In does not include the game, but does include all mods that can be legally included to enable that extended experience.

# NOTE

It now takes 10 minutes to load this install. I think this idea will need to be rethought. If I want to do this, I probably need to create a custom part CFG writer C# project.
